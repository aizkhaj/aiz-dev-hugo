“Hello World”.

Those two words on any other blog, are usually a filler. Here, a website with elements of web/software development and engineering, it’s completely appropriate.

Until I started developing more seriously, my experiences have mostly been on the business side of things: economics, finance (think capital markets, trading) and business analysis (working with data, incorporating IT solutions for business problems and more) sprinkled with some previous sparse web development experiences.

But.

## An Interest in Creating

I’ve always been a tinkerer. I’ve always enjoyed experimenting and I wanted to build really cool and meaningful things that solved problems (even if they’re trivial?). I’ve always wanted to build a business, or help build one with someone. I enjoy that stuff more, so I decided to jump into the software development arena. I want to create.

Now, I didn’t just wake up one day and said I was going to start coding things. It was actually something that developed over time.

I went to university for Business Economics. I really enjoyed the topic, but I was considering computer science too. I just enjoyed IT class, playing video games and keeping up with all things tech growing up.

Towards the end of university, I was fortunate enough to get some experience doing some web development work as a contractor. Consider it more of an intern/junior level experience though. HTML/CSS, some jQuery here and there. Mostly things like landing pages and the sort. Even then though, I remember how much I lacked in the CSS part.

## An Experiment with Creating

With the advent of all sorts of web development and mobile application related tutorials and educational content and websites, I just had to give it a shot. I had no excuses not to try it out. It started with signing up for codecademy, some beginner frontend stuff with Treehouse and even some courses at Udemy. To be honest, I wasn’t learning too much. I was basically doing exercises in syntax, but not building anything or with any goals in mind. This is where I sought some intern/junior level work to help me get better understanding building web pages.

Fast forward to Fall 2015, it was one particular course at Udemy that helped me take things a bit more seriously in coding. It was a course on Swift and developing mobile apps for the iOS ecosystem. I really enjoyed the instruction and got far enough to build a basic calculator app for the iPhone. Heck, I had just invested in a MacBook so I could use xcode and develop apps (I had built a gaming desktop PC up to that point and owned another dust-collecting Windows laptop).

Unfortunately, I didn’t end up finishing that course. I can’t remember if I got stuck, or just slowly dropped off of it because Object Oriented Programming was not making sense to me at the time. There was some support from the instructor, but I didn’t really know where I was stuck either.

Conveniently, this is also when I started exploring other options in further education or professional designations (think MBA, CFA). So I could have been distracted with that too.

## Bootcamp

I started looking into coding bootcamps more seriously sometime in 2016. I knew they were a thing, and they were good at what they offered. It was a perfect opportunity for me. By now, I had realized how much coding I’ve done, how many times I’ve attempted it and what I’d like to do with those skills. More importantly, I realized I can’t teach myself to code with that much discipline, and get unstuck on my own. I needed some structure and guidance with my self learning journey. Even though I love what I did professionally as a Business Analyst, I love working on side projects too. **Personal growth means everything to me**. I could learn this stuff while I worked full time – Perfect!

So I signed up with [Bloc](http://bloc.io) in late 2016, to take on their Software Developer Track _(EDIT: they've since changed how they structured their programs. A lot of the CS extras that I'm being taught are now add-on modules for their Web Development Track)_. I figured it’s perfect because not only will I learn some practical skills, I’ll be learning the good stuff from a computer science degree. Things like algorithms, data structures, and more.

It was an expensive decision, but I think it’s one of the best investments I’ve made in myself.

Speaking of investments, that's something I know a thing or two about and will bring up in other posts.
