# Hello, World. I'm Aizaz Khaja.

I'm a developer, writer and maker. I use this space to write about programming, tech, finance and anything else I'm curious about. You'll also find a sampling of the projects I'm exploring.

## Projects

### Halalscope

Find halal investing opportunities using [Halalscope](https://halalscope.co). It's a co-founded project focused on surfacing compliant investing ideas.

### Candlestickcharts.js

Created an open source library to help developers add static financial charts from provided data using JavaScript and HTML Canvas. [Explore the project on GitHub](https://github.com/aizkhaj/candlestickcharts.js).
